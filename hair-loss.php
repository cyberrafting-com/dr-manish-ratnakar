                                <p>In today's society, hair loss or patchy loss of hair is a common disorder that affects a lot of people. In the 30-60-year age group, men and women suffer from hair loss which degrades their confidence and affects their looks and personalities. Radiation (chemotherapy) causes hair loss or patchy bald spots in cancer patients. </p>
                                <p>Baldness is caused by the body's inability to produce new hair and remove the old ones. A number of known and common causes of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hair-loss-a-to-z"> hair loss (baldness) </a> include thyroid disease, anemia, protein deficiency, and secondary syphilis.

                                <p>Even individuals with healthy hair and scalps lose some hair every day, making it difficult for the initial stages of the disorder to be recognized as a serious problem. Hair loss can occur at any age, but generally starts after the age of 30 for both men and women.</p>
