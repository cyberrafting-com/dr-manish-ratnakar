                                <p>Lipo treatment or a liposuction operation is actually a formal liposuction cosmetic
                                    surgery procedure and involves liposuction fat removal by various modalities to
                                    achieve a liposuction surgery procedure. These may entail a regular or standard
                                    Suction Assisted Liposuction or the VASER Liposuction or LASER Liposuction. But
                                    these have come in to the market and have lost its charm in the western populations.
                                </p>

                                <p>We use new liposuction methods and specifically use the WaterJet which is known as
                                    the Aquajet Liposuction and is currently rated as the topmost, safest and gentlest
                                    of liposuction procedures in the world.
                                </p>

                                <p>Tummy liposuction, mini liposuction and that of some other areas may be achieved in
                                    only intravenous sedation and minimal anaesthesia. That is the best choice for this
                                    procedure with an operating time that depends in base at the areas of the body to be
                                    treated and the amount of fat to be removed. It is to be also noted that we
                                    regularly do liposuction for men.
                                </p>

                                <p>Liposuction is performed through small incisions. First, sterile liquid solution is
                                    infused to reduce bleeding and trauma. Then a thin hollow tube, or cannula, is
                                    inserted through these incisions to loosen excess fat using a controlled back and
                                    forth motion. The dislodged fat is then suctioned out of the body using a surgical
                                    vacuum or syringe attached to the cannula.
                                </p>

                                <p>Once the procedure is completed a compression garment or elastic bandages may cover

                                <p>It may take several months for the swelling to fully dissipate, as it does, your new
                                    contours and enhanced self-image should continue to develop. The loss of excess
                                    fatty tissue should be permanently maintained with continued practices of healthy
                                    diet and fitness. However, substantial weight gain can alter an otherwise permanent
                                    result.

                                <p>The decision to have liposuction surgery is personal and you can decide if the
                                    benefits will achieve your goals and if the risks and potential complications of
                                    liposuction are acceptable. All surgical procedures have some degree of risk;
                                    however fortunately significant complications from liposuction are infrequent.

                                <p>During the Aquashape™ liposuction technique for women as also in lipo for men, excess

                                    and not needed through a gentle process using a WaterJet.

                                <p>WaterJet Assisted Liposuction/ Aquashape™ is the newest and most recent method
                                    available for liposuction. The body jet machine we use is the only WaterJet assisted
                                    liposuction machine approved by the FDA. The body jet is so gentle that the fat and
                                    surrounding tissue retains its integrity. This is important because with this method
                                    the fat that has been sucked out is in its purest form and can be reinjected into
