                                <h2>Growth Factor Concentrate (GFC) Therapy</h2>
                                <p>In most cases, if we get a small wound due to trauma, the wound will heal by itself.
                                    Have you ever wondered how this happens?</p>
                                <p>The platelets in our blood stop bleeding at the site of wounds by sealing the blood
                                    vessels. They also secrete growth factors that stimulate the formation of new
                                    tissues and lead to wound closure.</p>
                                <p>Taking advantage of this miraculous property of platelets,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-rich_plasma"> PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) </a> 
                                    Therapy is used to treat a variety of medical and surgical conditions. Instead of
                                    platelets, GFC extracts growth factors from activated platelets and uses them for
                                    the same indications.</p>
                                <p>In today's world, hair loss is a common problem that must be addressed immediately.
                                    However, with Growth Factor Concentrate (GFC) Therapy Treatment, it can be quickly
                                    restored by reserving and restoring platelets from the body.</p>
                                    <h2> Advantages of GFC or Growth Factor Concentrate  ?</h2>
                                <p>Growth Factor Concentrate Therapy (GFC) is a safe and highly effective method of
                                    preparing concentrated growth factors using a candidate's own blood cells. It is an
                                    advanced PRP treatment that reduces hair fall and rejuvenates the face. The therapy
                                    is ideal for hormonal hair loss patients, and results can be seen in as little as
                                    2-3 sessions. The GFC uses activated growth factors from platelets in the
                                    candidate's blood to trigger the growth phase in the hormonally challenged hair
                                    roots.</p>
                                <p>Growth factors are present in blood platelets. The blood is extracted at a high
                                    concentration at <a href="https://www.drmanishratnakar.com/index.php">Revitalize
                                        Clinic</a> by <a href="https://www.drmanishratnakar.com/about.php">Dr. Manish
                                        Ratnakar</a>. After the GFC has been collected, it is administered at the site
                                    to be treated by precise tools. In the end, there is no platelet loss, and the
                                    process has no pyrogenous components, is secure, and regenerates damaged tissues in
                                    a natural way.</p>
                                <p>An individual can achieve the best results in 3-4 sessions using this advanced and
                                    cutting-edge hair loss treatment. For this reason, it is considered the best
                                    procedure to undergo to restore lost hair.</p>
                                <h2>Advanced Growth Factor Treatment for Hair at Revitalize Clinic</h2>
                                <h2>What is GFC or Growth Factor Concentrate  ?</h2>
                                <p>GFC - Growth Factor Concentrate - A non-invasive, ready-to-inject, autologous growth
                                    factor concentrate therapy developed in India. After extensive research, studies,
                                    and successful clinical trials, it is a big step by science to cure baldness.</p>
                                <p>At Revitalize Clinic you can get Growth Factor Concentrate therapy (GFC), where
                                    highly concentrated growth factors derived from your own blood are used for hair
                                    regrowth, scar treatment and skin rejuvenation. As already stated, GFC Therapy is an
                                    advanced, innovative therapy that takes advantage of the body's inherent healing
                                    powers.</p>
                                <h2>How does this treatment work?</h2>
                                <p>It focuses on regrowing existing hair follicles and stopping hair loss. By combining
                                    peptides, vitamins, minerals, and proteins, this product replenishes your scalp's
                                    roots with essential growth factors that mimic the natural growth factors that are
                                    already present in your scalp.</p>
                                <p>Consequently, hair growth becomes healthier and denser while hair loss is reduced.
                                    Hair follicles are repaired and the number of active hair follicles is increased
                                    using this treatment. Anagen growth is prolongated, hair follicles are repaired and
                                    active hair follicles are increased.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, hair transplantation can be restricted indefinitely if GFC treatment is
                                    initiated early.</p>
                                <h2>How long does it take to complete the treatment?</h2>
                                <p>It takes less than 30 minutes to complete the treatment. The procedure is safe,
                                    non-invasive, and does not leave any scars behind.</p>
                                <h2>How soon will you be able to see the results?</h2>
                                <p>Almost all clients see results after their first session. The best results are seen
                                    after three to four sessions. Cosmetologists, dermatologists, and hair experts
                                    approach each case differently, depending on the client's history, health, and
                                    diagnosis.</p>
                                <h2>For whom is this treatment intended?</h2>
                                <p>Whether you have early or late signs of alopecia, GFC therapy is equally effective
                                    for both men and women. The best way to ensure this is to get your scalp examined by

                                <h2>GFC preparation: How does it work?</h2>
                                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Obtaining blood samples.</p>
                                <p>Four GFC tubes are filled with 15ml to 16ml of the patient's peripheral blood,
                                    equally distributed.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Platelets are activated and growth factors are released.</p>
                                <p>A soft mixing step is performed by inverting the tube 6-10 times, followed by a 30
                                    minute stand time. By releasing PDGF, VEGF, EGF, and IGF-1 from the platelets, the
                                    platelet-activating solution in the GFC treatment helps activate platelets.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Separating GFC from the rest of the mixture.</p>
                                <p>After centrifugation at 3400 rpm for 10 minutes, all four tubes are counterbalanced.
                                    Furthermore, it allows pure GPs to be separated from RBCs, WBCs, and other blood
                                    cells.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> GFC collection.</p>
                                <p>GFC and Autologous growth factor concentrate are collected in the tubes. A collecting
                                    syringe is used to collect GFCs at the cap of the tube. A needle tip is inserted
                                    just under the cap of the tube. As a result, the GFC recovery rate is maximized.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Putting GFC to use.</p>
                                <p>Now that the GFC has been collected, it is ready for application on desired area. It
                                    is possible to get yellow, yellowish brown, orange, and reddish GFC output.</p>
                                <h2>In what way should the product be used?</h2>
                                <p>A single Follirich GFC therapy kit is used for one patient at a time.</p>
                                <p>In order to get the best results, it is recommended to have three sessions over three
                                    months.</p>
                                <p>There is a reduction in hair fall and an increase in hair count and thickness as a
                                    result of the treatment.</p>
                                <p>4-6 months after the procedure, one sitting may be repeated, and the treatment may be
                                    repeated annually.</p>

                                <p>Due to the fact that GFC is prepared from your own blood, it is completely safe. A
                                    strictly hygienic environment is maintained during all procedures, reducing the

                                <p>PRP contains blood cells; GFC does not. Therefore, GFC is extremely comfortable. In

                                <h2>Which Growth Factors are involved in GFC Therapy?</h2>
                                <p>As a result of the growth factors stored in blood platelets, tissues are regenerated
                                    and repaired, as well as stem cells are migrated and differentiated. Due to this,
                                    each GFC is responsible for fighting hair loss in a different way.</p>
                                <p><strong>Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF):</strong> As a stimulator of
                                    vascularization and angiogenesis, PDGF promotes hair growth. Moreover, it
                                    contributes to the proliferation and chemotaxis of fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem
                                    cells.</p>
                                <p><strong>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF):</strong> Perifollicular
                                    angiogenesis in hair is regulated by VEGF expression in DP cells during the anagen
                                    phase. During the anagen growth phase, it also increases the size of the
                                    perifollicular vessels.</p>
                                <p><strong>Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF):</strong> EGF stimulates mesenchymal and
                                    epithelial cell proliferation and regeneration. Additionally, it stimulates
                                    angiogenesis as well.</p>
                                <p><strong>Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1):</strong> IGF-1 promotes HF growth,
                                    increases overall hair growth, and stimulates angiogenesis.
                                <p>GFC therapy kits contain precise mechanisms to extract them from platelets at
                                        high concentrations.</p>
                                <h2>What is the difference between GFC therapy and PRP therapy?</h2>
                                <p>In the 1970s, PRP was used as a thrombocytopenia treatment; later on, it became
                                    popular in cosmetology in the 2000s. Biological products or portions of autologous
                                    blood plasma with high platelet counts are known as PRP. Each time, the outcome is
                                    different. It was difficult to remove RBCs and WBCs using single spin or double spin
                                    techniques. The healing effect was also associated with pain and inflammation
                                    associated with the posy procedure.</p>
                                <p>In the process of using this therapy for hair loss treatment, many challenges were
                                    encountered: It does not provide growth factors, but platelets, no standardized
                                    protocols were used, no determining quality or quantity clarity, conflicting
                                    results, and complexity of the process.</p>
                                <p>Patients' blood is also used for GFC treatments, and only high concentrations of
                                    growth factors are released when platelets are activated. The procedure is therefore
                                    effortless, and no platelets are lost. In addition, unlike PRP, GFC can be stored
                                    for 7 days at 4 degrees Celsius and 8 hours at room temperature. As a result, the
                                    overall results are optimal, with minimal pain, inflammation, and infection risk,
                                    and the procedure is shorter than usual.</p>
                                <h2>GFC Therapy: How much does it cost?</h2>
                                <p>In spite of being an innovative and superior hair loss treatment, GFC therapy is
                                    highly affordable. Depending on the area being treated, visible results can be
                                    seen within a few sessions of the therapy.</p>
